The idea is to compute conditional probabilities of possible correction options. For example, the phrase \"dking sport\" should be fixed as \"doing sport\" not \"dying sport\", while \"dking species\" -- as \"dying species\".\n\nThe best way to start is to analyze [Norvig's solution](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) and [N-gram Language Models](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf).\n\nWhen solving this task, we expect you'll face (and successfully deal with) some problems or make up the ideas of the model improvement. Some of them are: \n\n- \n\n- taking into account keyboard layout and associated misspellings;\n- efficiency improvement to make the solution faster;\n- ...\n\nPlease don't forget to describe such cases, and what you decided to do with them, in the Justification section.\n\n##### IMPORTANT:  \nYour project should not be a mere code copy-paste from somewhere. You must provide:\n- Your implementation\n- Analysis of why the implemented approach is suggested\n- Improvements of the original approach that you have chosen to implement","metadata":{"id":"x-vb8yFOGRDF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import re\nimport math\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nimport random\nimport time\nfrom typing import List\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-02-25T20:37:00.416259Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-02-25T20:37:00.416577Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-02-25T20:37:00.421530Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-02-25T20:37:00.416551Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-02-25T20:37:00.420240Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sentences = []\n\nwith open(\"/kaggle/input/nlp-assignment-1-training-dataset/eng_news_2024_300K-sentences.txt\", \"r\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as f:\n    for line in tqdm(f):\n        parts = line.strip().split(\"\\t\")\n        if len(parts) == 2:\n            _, sentence = parts\n\n            #

And after that lowercasing and removing extra spaces\n\nFor evaluating I take  [2014 European Union WEB 10k](https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download/English) dataset. Preprocessing was the same.\n# Choosing n in ngram model\nThe choice of n is cruicial in ngram model, since it strictly leads to accuracy. While searching in articles, I found that mostly n = 2-3 showed best performance. I took n = 3 to have more context for training.\n# Smoothing\nTo avoid recieving zero probability for n-gram that was not found in the training text, I applied Laplace smoothing. The model generalizes better with it when faced with new or rare word combinations.\n# Generate correction candidates\n1. Primary I generate correction using Insertions, Replacements, Transpositions, and Deletions. This broad search ensures most plausible corrections are considered.\n2. Since the depth = 2 recursive algorithm of 1st metod is slow and generates many candidates, I decided to save only 2 depth deletion. So, if first method didn't show valid candidate I use two-level deletions (e.g., \"test\" → \"tst\" → \"st\"). \n3. If upper method didn't worked give original word\n# Candidate selection\nDue to large amount of correction candidates generation, we need somehow to bound them. So I filter candidates based on their frequency of occurrence and take only first 14. This frequency-based filtering ensures that only the most probable candidates are considered, improving efficiency and reducing the computational load.\n# Penalties\nTo avoid over-correcting valid known words I added penalties to prefer existing, more probable words. Additional penalty is applied to make corrections allow for likely typos but still slightly penalize them to prefer the original word if it’s valid (e.g., rare words, names). Moreover, there exist multiplication pinalty. It reflects that two deletions are less likely to be valid corrections unless absolutely necessary.\n# Context\nEach candidate word's score is computed by considering its probability in the given context, which is determined by the trigram model. The final score combines the likelihood of the candidate in the context with penalties for known and unknown words.\n# Efficiency\nA key challenge in this task is the need to handle large datasets and quickly generate candidate corrections. To improve efficiency, I limited the number of candidates considered and used a simple heuristic to filter candidates by frequency. This reduces the number of computations and speeds up the spelling correction process.\n\nAdditionally, the model uses a pre-built word_to_id dictionary to quickly look up word IDs, which further speeds up both training and inference phases.\n# Keyboard Layout and Misspellings\nI didn't implement it in my approach\n\n# My approach\nMy approach was based on N-grams method with slightly modifications: reducing number of generation correction candidates, smoothing, filtering and bounding candidates. Moreover adding penalties to make context better and reduce misspelling correct words.
